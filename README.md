# Tensor-Rank-sln

This repository contains code that will help compute the rank of the Koszul Flattening of the Structure Tensor of sln. 

KoszulFlattening computes the Koszul flattening for a given tensor.

The next few files compute the highest weight vectors of sln \otimes \Wedge^p sln, for a given weight.

Please refer to sln.py to for koszul flattening implementations used in paper 'On the structure tensor of sln'
